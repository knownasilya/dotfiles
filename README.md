## Setting Up Vim
Copy `colors` and `bundle` directories to `~/.vim/`

For `vim-airline` to work, you must install https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts/tree/master/SourceCodePro fonts
and set them as your default font in iTerm2 (or whatever terminal you are using).

Run:
```
vim +BundleInstall
```
